## Build Setup
### NOTE: Make sure you have installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html), Cordova (optional; if you want to also run the app with android emulator or run it with your mobile device).
``` bash
# install dependencies
# ignore if there are errors, not sure if those were because of cordova dependencies, but it works naman regardless
npm install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
